1708215 Monday

Day began with the weekly monday meeting, the Minister assigned me a new responsibility: "Critical Mission" reports, update and overlook, excellent, because that means more opportunities to show my worth.
Decided to keep doing this, daily, write a few words, nothing much, but do it everyday.
Missing Alex, she has been in New Mexico since August 5th, miss her so incredibly much. We'll see eachother soon, on the 26th.
